        <p>
            I am a student in Oregon State University's online postbacc computer science program,
            interested in working in software development after I complete the program in May 2023.
            Currently I am in the Kansas City area.
            My hobbies include running, reading, hiking, and watching movies and TV.
            New hobbies include improving my programming knowledge and working on personal projects to add
            to this GitHub portfolio to show off my growing knowledge in the field.
