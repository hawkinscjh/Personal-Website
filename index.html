        <p>
            I am a student in Oregon State University's online postbacc computer science program,
            interested in working in software development after I complete the program in May 2023.
            Currently I am in the Kansas City area.
            My hobbies include running, reading, hiking, and watching movies and TV.
            New hobbies include improving my programming knowledge and working on personal projects to add
            to this GitHub portfolio to show off my growing knowledge in the field.

            <p>
                In pursuit of learning pygame's functionality, I implemented a game inspired by the popular Space Invaders game. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/hawkinscjh/SpaceInvaders">GitHub</a>.

            <p class="summary">
                Over the course of 8 weeks, I worked alongside a partner to develop a website with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) backend/server interaction capabilities utilizing mySQL and Node.js, as well as HTML/Handlebars, CSS and Javascript.
                The website was a fictional grocery supply with the ability to add/search/delete/update clients, contacts, sales reps, orders and products. Check out the project on <a href="https://github.com/hawkinscjh/cs340_database">GitHub</a>.
